# Fluid Engine Dev - Demo

This repository contains example scene files that I used for generating [Jet Framework demo](http://fluidenginedevelopment.org/examples/) and example figures for my book, [Fluid Engine Development](http://fluidenginedevelopment.org) (with some modification for the demonstration purpose). The scene files are based on [Mitsuba 0.5.0](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org). For more details about the schema itself, please refer to the Mitsuba documentation. This repository also contains sample simulation outputs unders `data` directory. Those are all generated using [the example apps](https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev/tree/master/src/examples) accompanied with Jet framework.

Any contributions to this repository are welcome. Also, it should not be limited by Mitsuba renderer, but rendering the data with other (open source, if possible) renderers would be very interesting.
